# ThermSDO
This Python 3 script for Raspberry Pi responds to SDO reads on CAN bus with temperature readings from a DS1621 thermometer via I<sup>2</sup>C.  Command line arguments may be used to set the I<sup>2</sup>C bus address for the DS1621, the CANOpen node number, and the SDO index number.  Temperature in degrees Celsius appears at subindex 1, as a 4-byte float.  Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit appears at subindex 2, as a 4-byte float.  The object dictionary is otherwise very sparse, as this implementation represents a small subset of CANOpen operations.  Conversions on the DS1621 are free-running, while SDO reads are paced by the CANOpen master node.  The [smbus](https://pypi.org/project/smbus2/), [python-can](https://pypi.org/project/python-can/), and [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) libraries are used here to good advantage.
